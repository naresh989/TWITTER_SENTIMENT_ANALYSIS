# TWITTER_SENTIMENT_ANALYSIS

CONCLUSION
After conducting a sentiment analysis of Twitter data using
various machine learning algorithms, including Decision
tree, Naive Bayes, KNN, CNN, and Random Forest, it was
found that the CNN algorithm performed the best with the
highest accuracy compared to the other models.
CNNs are a type of deep learning algorithm that are
particularly well-suited for image recognition, but they have
also shown to be highly effective in natural language
processing tasks such as sentiment analysis. The reason
behind this is that CNNs can capture the complex
relationships and patterns within text data through its layers
of convolutions.
Furthermore, it is worth noting that the other algorithms,
such as Naive Bayes, Decision tree, KNN, and Random
Forest, also performed well in sentiment analysis, but were
outperformed by CNN. Each of these algorithms has its own
strengths and weaknesses, and choosing the best algorithm
for a particular task will depend on various factors,
including the nature of the data and the problem at hand.

In conclusion, the sentiment analysis of Twitter data
revealed that CNN is a powerful algorithm with highest
accuracy of 75.88% in analyzing sentiment in text data.
However, further research and testing are required to
determine the optimal algorithm for specific tasks and
datasets.
